Odin Library

A simple web-based book tracker that lets users add books and view them in a styled card layout. Built as part of the Odin Project curriculum, this project demonstrates DOM manipulation, form handling, and modal implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features

    Add books with a title, author, and reading status

    Responsive, CSS Grid-based layout

    Modal input form with blur background effect

    Clean animations and hover states

    Simple design with custom fonts and color scheme

How It Works

    Click the "Add Book" card.

    A modal appears prompting for:

        Title

        Author

        Reading status (Not Read, Want to Read, etc.)

    Submit the form to dynamically add the book to the grid.

    The newly added book appears before the “Add Book” card.

Built With

    HTML5 – Semantic structure

    CSS3 – Grid layout, transitions, and modals

    JavaScript (ES6) – DOM manipulation and logic

    Font Imports – Lora & Poppins for visual polish
